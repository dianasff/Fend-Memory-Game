## Usage
* Click on the **CLICK TO START** button to start the game.
* Once you click on the **CLICK TO START** button, the cards will be able to click.
* The game has 16 cards, and 8 pairs of cards;
* You should find the pairs, making different moves. Every 2 moves you make, the game will compare the cards and see if it is equal, if it is, both cards will remain open and it will be disable. If it is not equal, both cards will be closed.
* Every open card is counted as a move. If you make under than 20 moves to finish the game, you will receive 3 stars, if you make between 20 and 24 moves, you will receive 2 stars, if you make between 25 and 30 moves, you will receive 1 star, if you make more than 30 moves you will receive no stars.
* Once you find all the pairs, you will receive a **Congatulations Message**. This message will tell you how many moves you made, how long you took to finish the game and the rating.
* HAVE FUN!
